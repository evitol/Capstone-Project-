    "Full-time childcare facilities for children aged 0 â€“ 5 years old in the United States are private businesses. Exceptions include part-time facilities which offer morning or afternoon care, typically in a pre-school setting provided by school districts.\n",
    "\n",
    " Some of the daycares offer franchise opportunities, for example Goddard School and Kiddie Academy [1-2]. At the same time, there are a lot of independent daycare facilities which cater to specific childcare needs in selected neighborhoods. Opening a new daycare business requires a thorough analysis of the existing competition as well as the analysis of socioeconomic situation in the given neighborhood. Running a daycare is considered an attractive opportunity for people looking to own a business, providing the much-needed options for the childcare needs for families with small children [3].\n",

    "The city of Chicago, being the largest city in the Midwest United States, with the estimated population of 2.7 million [4], serves as a home to many different companies within the city limits. As a result, there is a large number of working parents looking for childcare arrangements in the Chicago area. According to the census data, there are approximately 175,000 children under the age of 5 in Chicago [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a recommendation on which of the neighborhoods in the city of Chicago would be attractive for starting a new daycare business. \n"
